                                        Our website uses cookies. A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string

                                        stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time
                                        the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent”
                                        cookies or “session” cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web

                                        user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at
