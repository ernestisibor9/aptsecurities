                                        Below are the terms and conditions that are binding on all clients who maintain
                                        a stock broking account with APT Securities and Funds Limited ("APT Securities")
                                        and use its online trading portal:

                                        <li>Mandates can be forwarded to APT Securities through our on-line stock
                                            broking portal (E-Biz) which can be accessed via
                                            www.aptsecuritiesonline.com. Mandates can also be sent via e-mail to the
                                            dedicated e-mail address: info@aptsecurities.com

                                        <li>
                                            The client hereby indemnifies APT Securities against any loss, omission or
                                            damage that clients may incur when APT Securities executes any mandate,
                                            instructions, or other communications furnished by client by any electronic
                                            media or means. This indemnity subsists whether such electronic mandates are
                                            transmitted directly through a computer owned by client or otherwise, at any
                                            time, and in relation to any business or transactions, which client may have
                                            with APT Securities, or in which APT Securities may be acting on client’s
                                            behalf or in accordance with client’s instructions.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Mandates sent using the dedicated email address or online trading portal
                                            should be explicit in stating price limits (or at market) and duration for
                                            which the mandate is valid. For mandates sent via the online trading portal,
                                            they would be valid for one day only (i.e. between 11.00am- 2.00pm Where the
                                            mandate cannot be executed due to market conditions, it would be expunged
                                            from the system at the end of the business day. Where a client still wishes
                                            to execute such mandates, he/she would be required to resend the mandate the
                                            next business day.

                                            APT Securities will endeavour to execute all mandates; however, execution of
                                            mandates cannot be guaranteed as this largely depends on market conditions.
                                            It is therefore possible for a mandate not to be executed even if the
                                            instruction received was to carry out the transaction at market price.

                                            Buy mandates will only be executed if the client’s in-house account is
                                            sufficiently funded to cover the cost of the transaction.

                                            Clients will receive a contract note at the close of every business day

                                            Proceeds from sales will only be transferred to clients after settlement.
                                            Settlement shall be three business days (T +3) after the mandate was
                                            executed and provided the clients had previously sent all outstanding Know
                                            Your Customer (KYC) documents requested by APT Securities. It should be
                                            noted that unless a request is received, the funds will remain in the
                                            clients non-interest bearing stock broking account.

                                            Mandates placed through the online portal are executed directly on the
                                            Nigerian Stock Exchange without any manual interference.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Cancellation of mandates can be done on the online portal after trading
                                            hours while clients can forward their cancellation orders to
                                            mandate@aptsecurities.com if they wish to cancel an open order during
                                            trading hours. Cancellation of mandates will depend on the status of the
                                            mandate i.e. cancellation can only be done if the order has not been
                                            executed on the Exchange.
