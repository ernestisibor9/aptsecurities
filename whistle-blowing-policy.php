                                            accountability and fairness;  Other forms of corporate governance breaches;

                                            above listed reportable misconducts or concerns are not exhaustive. However,
                                            judgment and discretion are required to determine misconduct that should be
                                            reported under this policy. The general guide in identifying reportable
                                            misconduct is to report concerns which are repugnant to the interest of the
                                            company and the general public and appropriate sanctions applied. Finally,
                                            this policy does not cover individual staff grievances and other employee
                                            related matters already covered in the staff hand-books of APT Securities

                                        <li>The Board and Management are aware that a robust internal system for
                                            employees and other relevant stakeholders to disclose workplace malpractices
                                            without fear of reprisal shows that employees take their responsibilities
                                            seriously, and also helps to avoid the negative publicity that often
                                            accompanies disclosures to external parties. Hence the Board of Directors
                                            and Management is committed towards promoting a culture of openness,
                                            accountability and integrity, and will not tolerate any harassment,
                                            victimization or discrimination of the whistleblower provided such
                                            disclosure is made in good faith with reasonable belief that what is being
                                            reported is fact.</li>

                                            Establish if a wrongdoing has occurred based on the concern(s) raised, and

                                            with such service provider, and if necessary terminate the agreement. 4 Step
                                            Four Non-Satisfaction with result of investigation/action. In the event that

                                            whistleblower is at liberty to report to the Chairman of the Board Audit
                                            Committee for further action. An external whistleblower shall be at liberty
                                            to report to appropriate regulatory body or seek further redress in the
                                            court of laws If he/she is not satisfied with the action taken to address
                                            the concern(s). 8. Time Limit for Investigation It shall be the policy of
                                            the company to handle investigations promptly and as fairly as possible.
                                            While it might not be possible to set a specified time frame for the
                                            conclusion of investigation, since the diverse nature of potential concerns

                                            and  the possibility of confirming the allegation. Where necessary,
                                            compensation of whistleblowers whether internal or external that have
                                            suffered detriment shall be at the discretion of Management taking into
