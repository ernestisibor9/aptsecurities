                                        The purpose of this document is to provide clients of APT Securities and Funds
                                        Limited (henceforth referred to as APT or we or us) with information in relation
                                        to our Order Execution Policy.
                                    </p>

                                        The Order Execution Policy outlines the reasonable steps taken by us to ensure
                                        that we obtain the best possible results, for our clients, when executing their
                                        orders
                                    </p>

                                        APT to undertake all reasonable steps to obtain the best possible result for its
                                        clients (henceforth referred to as clients or you), taking into account price,
                                        costs, speed, likelihood of execution and settlement, size, nature and/or any
                                        other relevant order execution consideration, whether we are executing orders on
                                        behalf of clients or placing orders with, or passing orders to, others for
                                        execution. This overarching obligation is to obtain the best possible result for
                                        clients is referred to, in this document, as our obligation of Best Execution.

                                    <h6 class="h6">SCOPE</h6>
                                    <p>
                                        This document applies only to clients of APT on dealings with Financial
                                        Instruments.
                                        Best Execution is only owed when APT accepts an order to execute a transaction
                                        on
                                        the client’s behalf or in other circumstances where it has otherwise expressly
                                        agreed to accept such Best Execution obligation. i.e where you are relying on
                                        APT to
                                        act on his/her behalf in professional way.
                                    </p>
                                    <h6 class="h6">LIMITATIONS TO SCOPE OF BEST EXECUTION</h6>
                                    <p>
                                        In all cases the application of the Best Execution obligation will be limited by
                                        the Exchange’s price limit per stock per day, the nature of the order given by
                                        you. Such cases include highly structured transactions. The Best Execution
                                        obligation applies to all that requested for it, to highly structured
                                        off-exchange transactions where, due to the unique contractual structure entered
                                        into between Client and APT. Although Best Execution technically applies, there
                                        is little or nothing against which to compare the transaction. This applies on
                                        NSE and OTC transactions, which is (i) highly structured/customized to the
                                        particular client and, therefore, (ii) is not one of a series of similar deals
                                        to which the firm is a counterparty, and (iii) there is nothing comparable in
                                        the market.

                                        If the Client provides us with a specific instruction to deal on his / her
                                        behalf may prevent us from following some or all of the steps outlined in the

                                        Where the Client gave us a specific instruction, we will take all reasonable

                                        instruments, we will take all reasonable steps to achieve what is called “best
                                        execution” of the orders. This means that we will have in place a policy and
                                        procedures which are designed to obtain the best possible execution result,
                                        subject to and taking into account the nature of your orders, the priorities
                                        placed upon us in filling those orders and the market in question and which
                                        provides, in our view, the best balance across a range of sometimes conflicting
                                        factors.
                                    </p>

                                        We will take into consideration a range of different factors which include not
                                        just price, but which may also include such other factors as the need for timely
                                        execution, the liquidity of the market (which may make it difficult to even
                                        execute an order), the size of the order and the nature of the transaction.

                                        We will also take into account Client’s understanding and experience of the
                                        market in question, dealing profile, the nature of the dealing service required
                                        of us and the specific and general instructions given to us by Client which may
                                        be prioritized in filling the orders.

                                        In determining the relative importance of the factors affecting the execution
                                        process and thereby formulating our best execution policy, we have, using our
                                        judgment and longstanding experience in the market, considered that your own
                                        execution priorities when using our services and those of similar firms to ours
                                        are:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>speed of execution, namely to see a price and match your trades;</li>
                                        <li>transparency of execution, that the price quoted is the price at which the
                                            trade is executed;</li>
                                        <li>transparency of dealing costs, that the spread and commission rates are
                                            known before you choose to trade and there are no unknown fees that will be
                                            revealed only after you have traded;</li>
                                        <li>where you wish to execute (for example) an abnormally large order or an
                                            order in an illiquid market, which is not to be closed over the trading
                                            platform, you will be advised before the trade is executed of any factors
                                            which may affect our ability to execute the trade in any manner which
                                            deviates from our normal procedures and that of The Exchange how those
                                            factors may affect the execution of the trade;</li>
                                        <li>accurate pricing: our trading software encompasses the most sophisticated
                                            pricefiltering systems available in the market and provides clients with
                                            promptly updated prices on board which can be trusted and relied upon;</li>
                                        <li>re-quote policy: in normal market conditions, we may re-quote your order
                                            before executing your trade, where the market is moving in your favour and a
                                            more favourable price can be offered than the price you have seen on your
                                            platform. Note: in certain circumstances, any specific instructions from you
                                            may prevent us from taking the steps that we have designed and implemented
                                            in our execution policy to obtain the best possible result for the execution
                                            of those orders, in respect of the elements covered by those instructions.
                                        </li>

                                        and for a specified size (a ‘‘limit order’’), then it may not always be possible

                                        required to make your order public (i.e. show the order to the market) in such a
                                        case unless you agree that we need not do so. We think it is in your best

                                        public. By agreeing to this you agree to us not making your orders public, save
                                        where we consider it is in your best interests to do so – through Whole or None,
